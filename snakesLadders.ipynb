    "Firstly, we will need to create a board, with a set of ladders and snakes. The way we have chosen to do so is by letting the user choose the number of snakes and ladders, as well as the length of the board, and then randomly generating the specified number of each. Both ladders and snakes are in the form of lists of lists, where each inner list has 2 elements: the starting point of the ladder/snake, and the endpoint. The function *generateSnakesAndLadders* gives us both the ladders and the snakes simultaneously. "
